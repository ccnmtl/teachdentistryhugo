## Enjoy teaching tomorrow’s dentists today to ensure a fulfilling legacy to your dental career.

For the individual later in his or her career, the vast sum of knowledge that one may bring to education cannot be overstated. Financially, the burden is clearly less, but more importantly the opportunity to pass on the accumulated experience of many years of practice is beyond measure. To help a student in the clinical setting or when he/she is contemplating the future is a rare and unique opportunity and a very fulfilling experience. Passing on ethical standards by manifesting them as a role model can come only from many years of unique personal experiences.

Perhaps most importantly, the development of clinical judgment, when to jump in and perform a procedure, or when to go more slowly and contemplate alternatives, and other critical decision-making processes are perhaps some of the most challenging to convey to a student of our profession. Only through years of making such decisions and understanding the ramifications can one possess the knowledge base from which to become a mentor and educator in such nuanced matters.
