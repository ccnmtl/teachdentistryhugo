## Enjoy teaching tomorrowâ€™s faculty today to share your clinical acumen as a dentist.

When the daily routine becomes just routine, the opportunity to be with colleagues discussing the latest technology and patient care is a refreshing change. Additionally, the affordability may be more reasonable at this stage than earlier in your career, and the respect of the community at large is magnified considerably.

Many states offer continuing education credit for being an educator. The opportunity to serve as a trusted and reasonable mentor to dental students is not only a fascinating experience, but is also an extraordinary opportunity to be in touch your own values in the day-to-day world of private practice. Knowing what a current student is, or should be, contemplating when deciding whether to set up a practice or to seek advanced education specialty training can be immeasurably helpful.
