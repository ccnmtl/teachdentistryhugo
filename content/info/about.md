title: "About Teach Dentistry"
---

According to the Journal of Dental Education, clinical faculty shortages could be characterized as the most critical challenge confronting dentistry.

For students and practitioners who contemplate becoming educators, two main impediments hold them back: personal concerns about competency as educators and questions about how to get involved. Mentoring is a reciprocal interpersonal relationship that has been suggested to help increase personal and professional development within dental academics.

Teach Dentistry aims to inform and provide confidence to dental practitioners interested in entering dental academics by:

1. Having participants choose their interests while learning about the different aspects of dental education.
2. Viewing diverse exemplars at different stages of their careers, working in various areas within dental academics.
3. Seeking a mentor from a map of dental academicians throughout the country

This module was developed with support from the Health Resources and Services Administration Title VII Training Grant D86HP24475 on Teaching Tomorrowâ€™s Faculty Today.
